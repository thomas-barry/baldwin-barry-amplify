# GalleryEditor Component Implementation

## Overview

The GalleryEditor component has been successfully implemented and integrated into the Baldwin Barry Amplify application. This component provides a comprehensive interface for managing gallery images with drag-and-drop reordering and thumbnail selection functionality.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Thumbnail Grid Display

- **Grid Layout**: Images are displayed in a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- **Thumbnail URLs**: Uses AWS Amplify Storage to generate secure, temporary URLs for image thumbnails
- **Fallback Images**: Gracefully handles missing thumbnails by falling back to original images
- **Loading States**: Shows appropriate loading spinners while images are being fetched

### 2. Drag-and-Drop Reordering

- **Library**: Uses `@dnd-kit` (already installed) - a modern, accessible, and performant drag-and-drop library
- **Sortable Grid**: Images can be reordered using intuitive drag-and-drop interactions
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides visual feedback during dragging with opacity changes and drag overlays
- **Order Persistence**: Automatically saves the new order to the database using the `order` field in `GalleryImage` model
- **Touch Support**: Fully supports touch devices for mobile users

### 3. Gallery Thumbnail Selection

- **Visual Selection**: Click on any image to select it as the gallery thumbnail
- **Current Thumbnail Indicator**: Shows which image is currently set as the gallery thumbnail
- **Database Updates**: Updates the `thumbnailImageId` field in the Gallery model
- **Toast Notifications**: Provides user feedback when thumbnail is successfully updated

### 4. User Experience Features

- **Admin-Only Access**: Only admin users can access the editor (enforced by authentication check)
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Navigation**: Easy navigation back to galleries list and individual gallery views
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Empty States**: Handles galleries with no images gracefully

## Routes and Navigation

### New Route Added

- **Path**: `/galleries/$galleryId/edit`
- **Component**: `GalleryEditor`
- **File**: `/src/routes/galleries/$galleryId/edit.tsx`

### Navigation Integration

1. **GalleryCard Component**: Added edit button for admin users alongside the delete button
2. **Gallery Component**: Added edit button in the gallery header for quick access
3. **GalleryEditor**: Includes "Back to Galleries" button for easy navigation

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models Used

- **Gallery**: Uses `thumbnailImageId` field for storing selected thumbnail

- **Image**: Provides image data and S3 keys for thumbnails

### API Operations

- **Update**: Updates image order and gallery thumbnail selections
- **Real-time Updates**: Uses React Query for automatic cache invalidation and updates

### Libraries and Dependencies

- **@dnd-kit/sortable**: Sortable container and items
- **@dnd-kit/utilities**: Utility functions for drag-and-drop
- **AWS Amplify Storage**: For secure image URL generation
- **PrimeReact**: UI components for buttons, cards, and notifications
- **React Query**: Data fetching and caching
