## AWS Amplify React+Vite Starter Template

This repository provides a starter template for creating applications using React+Vite and AWS Amplify, emphasizing easy setup for authentication, API, and database capabilities.

## Overview

This template equips you with a foundational React application integrated with AWS Amplify, streamlined for scalability and performance. It is ideal for developers looking to jumpstart their project with pre-configured AWS services like Cognito, AppSync, and DynamoDB.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Setup with Amazon Cognito for secure user authentication.
- **API**: Ready-to-use GraphQL endpoint with AWS AppSync.
- **Database**: Real-time database powered by Amazon DynamoDB.

## Development Scripts

### Cleanup Data

To clear all data from your development environment:

```bash
npm run cleanup
```

This script will:

- Delete all records from Image and GalleryImage DynamoDB tables
- Remove all objects from the `uploads/` and `thumbnails/` directories in your S3 media bucket

**⚠️ Warning**: This operation is destructive and cannot be undone. Use with caution, especially in production environments.

**Prerequisites**:

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Valid `amplify_outputs.json` file (generated by running your Amplify sandbox)

## Deploying to AWS

For detailed instructions on deploying your application, refer to the [deployment section](https://docs.amplify.aws/react/start/quickstart/#deploy-a-fullstack-app-to-aws) of our documentation.
