# Baldwin-Barry Photo Gallery

A full-stack photo gallery application built with React, TypeScript, Vite, and AWS Amplify Gen 2.

## Overview

This application provides a complete photo gallery solution with user authentication, image upload and management, and gallery organization capabilities. It leverages AWS Amplify Gen 2 for backend services including Cognito for authentication, DynamoDB for data storage, and S3 for image storage.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite 7
- **UI Components**: PrimeReact
- **Routing**: Tanstack Router (file-based)
- **Data Fetching**: Tanstack Query
- **Backend**: AWS Amplify Gen 2
- **Database**: Amazon DynamoDB
- **Storage**: Amazon S3
- **Authentication**: Amazon Cognito

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- AWS CLI configured (e.g., `aws sso login --profile <your-aws-profile>`)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd baldwin-barry-amplify
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Amplify sandbox** (generates backend resources)
   ```bash
   npx ampx sandbox
   ```
   This will create an `amplify_outputs.json` file in the root directory containing your backend configuration.

4. **Start the development server** (in a separate terminal)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This runs TypeScript compilation followed by Vite bundling. The output will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production (TypeScript + Vite)
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run cleanup` - Clear all data from DynamoDB and S3 (⚠️ destructive!)

## Development Guidelines

For comprehensive coding guidelines, see [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](.github/copilot-instructions.md).

### Key Conventions

- Use **TypeScript** for all code
- Use **functional components** with React hooks
- Use **CSS Modules** for component styling
- Use **Tanstack Query** for all server state
- Use **path aliases** (`@/components/...`) instead of relative imports
- Follow the **PascalCase** naming for components, **camelCase** for functions/variables

## Common Issues

### Build Error: Cannot find module '../amplify_outputs.json'

**Cause**: The `amplify_outputs.json` file is missing. This file is generated by the Amplify sandbox and contains backend configuration.

**Solution**: Run `npx ampx sandbox` to generate the file.

### TypeScript Errors in amplify/ Directory

**Cause**: The `amplify/` directory has its own dependencies that need to be installed.

**Solution**:
```bash
cd amplify
npm install
cd ..
```

## Development Scripts

### Cleanup Data

To clear all data from your development environment:

```bash
npm run cleanup
```

This script will:

- Delete all records from Image and GalleryImage DynamoDB tables
- Remove all objects from the `uploads/` and `thumbnails/` directories in your S3 media bucket

**⚠️ Warning**: This operation is destructive and cannot be undone. Use with caution, especially in production environments.

**Prerequisites**:

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Valid `amplify_outputs.json` file (generated by running your Amplify sandbox)

## Deploying to AWS
